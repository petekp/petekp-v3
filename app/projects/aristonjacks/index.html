      <h3>Project Background</h3>
      Ariston and I met in 2008 at the loft space were we both lived. His door was ajar with great music spilling out and I caught a glimpse of some impressive, half-finished paintings lining the walls. Since then Ariston and I have been friends and creative partners who've worked together on a handful of websites for a variety of folks including New Jersey-based non-profit <a href="http://f3bscholars.org" target="_blank">F3B</a> and local Little Rock artist <a href="http://www.latoyamhobbs.com/" target="_blank">Latoya M. Hobbs</a>. Ariston's own site is something we team up on every couple years to show off his new collections and artistic directions. The iteration of his site shown above was created in 2009 and is Flash-based (likely the last Flash site I'll have done). I'm very happy with the visuals and presentation we achieved, particularly the initial animation of the 'Arisphere' dropping out of the floor revealing a galactic expanse; this theme reflects the direction of Ariston's art at the time which included many references to space and the far-future.
      <p>Ariston's new site will be released early 2013.</p>
