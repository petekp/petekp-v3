      <h3>Project Background</h3>
      Blue Planet Network has been at the forefront of an effort to exponentially improve the quality, efficiency, and long term impact of WASH (Water, Sanitation &amp; Hygiene) projects across the world. Enter BPN 2.0, an ambitious social platform based on a dynamic, human-powered knowledge base that makes intelligent recommendations for new projects based on historical data. Additionally the platform supports:
      <ul>
        <li>Funders to discover new projects in need of funding</li>
        <li>Project implementers to feature their projects in need of funding</li>
        <li>Local communities to get more involved in both the planning and implementation processes</li>
        <li>Long-term (minimum of 10 years) tracking and monitoring of water projects to determine what works and what doesn't</li>
        <li>A public layer that makes it easy for anybody to donate to a particular project and follow its progress</li>
      </ul>
      With only a few months available to us, our team at HiDef created the prototypes necessary for BPN to secure the seed funding necessary to fully realize BPN 2.0 which is now under development and set for release in the next year.
