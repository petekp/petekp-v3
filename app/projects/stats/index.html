      <h3>Project Background</h3>
      <p>Stats 2 is the successor to Stats, a custom web application created by Causelabs for Faith Comes by Hearing, a digital ministry most known for their 400+ text and audio Bible translations distributed across a variety of mediums and platforms.</p>
      <p>Stats is a 'command center' for visualizing data related to their different distribution channels; a way of seeing everything from the popularity of a particular translation available on iOS and Android in different parts of the world, to the average length of time users spend listening to particular chapters. Stats is presented on 5 televisions; 1 large 60-inch TV in the center displays the visuals posted above, while 2 TVs on either side of this screen display ancillary statistics that promote the increasing adoption of FCBH's offerings. Stats is often used as a presentation tool by FCBH staff when meeting with potential donors. Its clear and linear navigation was created to better suit the flow of these presentations and support the overall message that FCBH is having a real and increasing impact on the international scene and is well worth investing in.</p>
      <p>This was a fun and unique project to work on, being my first multi-screen project. It was also my first deep-dive into using primarily CSS3 for layout structure and styling versus traditional rasterized Photoshop graphics. Developing specifically for Webkit gave me the chance to create custom modular layout framework using the new <a href="http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2011/09/19/css3-flexible-box-layout-explained/" target="_blank">flexible box model in CSS3</a>.</p>
