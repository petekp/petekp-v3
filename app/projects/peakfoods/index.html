      Peakfoods is the solution to a problem I had: <em>how can I easily find what foods are in season where I live? </em> There are scattered resources around the web that offer this information, but it's buried in nested links and marred by bad UI. Eating well is pretty important, and this information deserved better treatment, I thought.
      <p>In the process of developing Peakfoods, I learned a lot about the benefits of seasonal food. Besides just tasting better, seasonal foods:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Have higher vitamin and nutrient retention</li>
        <li>Cost less as they don’t need to be packed and shipped long distances</li>
        <li>Reduce fossil-fuel usage and carbon emissions</li>
        <li>Better support your local economy and local farming</li>
        <li>Require little to no processing or chemicals to preserve freshness</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This turned out to be a bigger deal that I'd originally thought, and has motivated me to explore additional features for Peakfoods that will make it easier to find seasonal recipes, and local markets that provide the necessary ingredients.</p>
      Work has begun on Peakfoods 2.0. My lofty goal is to have the web release ready late 2014, followed later by a native app on iOS.
