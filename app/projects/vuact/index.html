      <p>Vuact makes video on the web smarter. With a few clicks, our video player be easily added to any web video (live or archived), be it from YouTube, Vimeo, BrightCove, or any player with a well-rounded API. The Vuact player lets video viewers react and comment on any part of a video by pressing the customizeable buttons at the bottom of the player; viewers can now help one another discover the most interesting parts of videos. This has many interesting implications for Sports, Politics and Education in particular. Another by product of this data is the ability to generate Smart Previews which allow viewers to see a short trailer of the most interesting parts of a video before they commit to watching the whole thing.</p>
      <p>My responsibilities at Vuact included all visuals (branding and styling), UX/UI design, and the HTML/CSS side of the front-end. In addition to designing and helping code the player itself, I built at least 3 different landing pages for the product as the product vision evolved.</p>
