      <h3>Project Background</h3>
      StreetSync is a web application we created at HiDef for StandUp for Kids, a non-profit rescuing homeless and at-risk youth. With StreetSync, teams and individuals can quickly report relevant data using a mobile web app synced to a central hub that saves and visualizes the data for tracking and reports. An administrator can quickly add volunteers and assign them to teams, and assign teams a specific inventory of trackable items related to a particular mission which could be anything from # of people assisted to # of pamphlets handed out. The beauty of the system was in its contextual malleability. In the mockups posted above, I was experimenting with an inventory of Exercise-related items; pushups, situps, etc. to demonstrate how it could be used for tracking almost anything.
      <p>StreetSync is no longer being developed or supported but may return.</p>
