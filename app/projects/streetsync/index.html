      <h3>Project Background</h3>
      StreetSync is a web application we developed pro-bono at <a href="http://causelabs.co" target="_blank">Causelabs</a> for StandUp for Kids, a non-profit rescuing homeless and at-risk youth. With StreetSync, teams and individuals can quickly report relevant data using a mobile web app synced to a central database with an admin dashboard that provided data visualization and project management tools; administrators can quickly add volunteers and assign them to teams; teams are assigned a specific inventory of trackable items related to a particular charitable effort. These items would be anything from the number of water bottles handed out to the number of pamphlets handed out. The beauty of this system was its ability to conform to many different contexts in which one would need to track pretty much anything. Some of the screens above refer to potential uses in tracking multiple individuals' exercise progress.
