      <p>Still in the initial design stages, Forge is an idea that's been slowly taking shape in my thoughts for over a decade. Part game, part powerful habit-changing tool, Forge is the synthesis of the latest research in human behavior with tried and true game mechanics from modern and classic games. There are many habit-changing apps available now, but a majority of them rely on outdated and uninspiring mechanics that just aren't engaging. My hope with Forge is to break new ground in the emerging space between gaming and personal improvement.</p>
